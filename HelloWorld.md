Since a PuReWidgets application is also a GWT application, it's entry point is GWT's onModuleLoad() method. In the entry point, we simply load our application, giving it a default instance id (this can be replaced by the place owner, so don't rely on it).

After the application is loaded, it will call the onPDApplicationLoaded(), where we can build on the functionalities of PuReWidgets.

In this HelloWorld example, we simply create an action button widget. All widgets must have an id given by the programmer, unique among the application's widgets. The button also has a label, which is displayed graphically on the public display.

To display the button on the public display, we need to add it to the document. This is done just like a standard GWT widget, with
```
RootPanel.get("buttonDiv").add(button);Â 
```
This is not a required step, as PuReWidgets' widgets are actionable even if they are not visible.

In PuReWidgets, all widgets trigger an ActionEvent that describes the high-level event generated by the widget in response to user input. For the button, we simply need to check which button (in this example, we didn't even need to check this because there is only one, but in general you will have to) has triggered the event, and act accordingly.
